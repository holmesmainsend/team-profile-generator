## Description
Countless organizations would benefit from having a single webpage to easily find all staff information. This application - through Node.js - allows users to create just that. While the sample file here is generated with Managers, Engineers, and Interns, changing the framework to generate anything from Teachers to Doctors would be a matter of a few quick JS edits.


## Installation
  To install node, got to the nodejs.org website and click the link for the latest appropriate version. Next, run "npm i inquirer" from the command line to install inquirer. Thankfully, the internet is teeming with tutorials and documentation on these tools, so if you run into installation errors you can most likely find the answer in no time at all.

## Credits and/or Contributing
  A big thank you to freecodeacademy for their fantastic free help vidoes.

## Testing
  As seen in the walkthrough video, deliberately trying to break the program is an easy way to test that it is truly functional. Error detection has been made easier for users by the inclusion of console.logs for both the prompts (e.g. "Please enter a description" if the description field is left blank by mistake) and the final writing of the HTML file. Feel free to reach out if there are errors in testing the prompts, the HTML file generation, or something else entirely.
